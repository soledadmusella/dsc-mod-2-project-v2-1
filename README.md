Flatiron Second Project

The purpose of this analysis is to predict the sales price of the propertis using the combiation of different variables. The insights that I obtained thanks to this first analysis would be the base to continue to explore other models until I will achieved satisfactory results in order to predict the price of real state market. 

SUMMARY

On the Index.ipynp you can access to all the following analysis and follow it the step by step.  
Starting from a huge dataset of the Seattle property market my first step was to clean the dataset by dropping the null values and inspect all the columns in order to get familiar with the dataframe and make my initials assumptions. Once done the data cleaning and the data inspecting I plotted the variables in order to have a first understanding of their correlation upon the price. After doing this preliminar analysis I stared with the real statistical analysis. I created 4 models by adding some variables and dropping other variables in order to see their correlation between eachother and to understand which variable can be a good predictor for the price. Lastly I formulated the following 3 business questions:

- As grade and bathrooms show multicollinearity, which is the most significant variable in predicting the price?
- Does having a waterfront in the house has a positive impact in the price?
- How does compare the houses built before 1975 and after 1975 upon the price?

With this questions I can help and guide the real estate market to do the best business choises. In order to validate the the hypotesis that I've formulated in my business questions I uded plots and t tests. 

Conclusion

It is necessary to spend more time exploring the data and on the data clearing process as the correlations visualitations of the parameters would have improved. The models that i' ve built are not really fitting the linear regression assumptions( as is clearly shown from the plots)of normality and homoscedasticity so the models need to be defenetlly improved.
